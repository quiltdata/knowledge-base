# IAM Policy Q&A - Engineering Review and Customer Safety Recommendations

## Engineering Response to PR Feedback

Based on engineering review feedback indicating potential inaccuracies in preliminary responses and the need for customer safety recommendations.

## Corrected Analysis and Safety Recommendations

### 1. Blank IAM Access Policies - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

**Current Status:** QA2 suggests these are "intentionally neutered placeholder policies" - this needs engineering confirmation.

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- Document the purpose of each policy with clear comments in the CloudFormation template
- Consider using AWS IAM policy conditions to make intentions explicit
- Provide deployment documentation explaining the zero-trust initialization approach
- Add CloudFormation outputs showing which policies will be populated post-deployment

**Questions for Engineering:**

- Are these policies actually populated dynamically at runtime?
- What triggers the policy population process?
- Can we provide customers with a list of final permissions that will be granted?

### 2. Too Loose IAM Policies - **REQUIRES SCOPING REVIEW**

**Current Status:** QA2 justifies wildcards for "vendored product flexibility" - needs validation of actual necessity.

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Immediate:** Add detailed policy documentation explaining each wildcard usage
- **Short-term:** Implement resource tagging strategy to scope permissions where possible
- **Long-term:** Evaluate if policy templates can be pre-scoped to customer environment

**Specific Improvements:**

```yaml
# Instead of Resource: '*' for S3, consider:
Resource:
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:s3:::${CustomerBucketPrefix}*'
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:s3:::${CustomerBucketPrefix}*/*'

# For Athena, scope to workgroups:
Resource:
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:athena:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:workgroup/quilt-*'
```

### 3. Dynamic IAM Policy Creation - **HIGH PRIORITY REVIEW**

**Current Status:** This is the most concerning finding and needs immediate engineering clarification.

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Mandatory:** Implement policy templates with restricted policy paths
- **Mandatory:** Add policy validation to ensure only approved policy structures can be created
- **Consider:** Policy approval workflow for any dynamic policy creation

**Suggested Constraints:**

```yaml
PolicyPath: !Sub '/quilt/${AWS::StackName}/${AWS::Region}/'
AllowedActions:
  - 's3:GetObject'
  - 's3:PutObject'
  # Explicitly list allowed actions, no wildcards
```

**Critical Questions for Engineering:**

- What specific scenarios require dynamic policy creation?
- Can these be replaced with pre-defined policy templates?
- What prevents restricting the IAM creation scope further?

### 4. CloudTrail Configuration - **CUSTOMER CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED**

**Current Status:** Minimal configuration may be intentional but creates compliance gaps.

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Provide CloudFormation parameters** for optional CloudTrail enhancement:
  - `EnableCloudWatchLogs` (boolean)
  - `CloudWatchLogGroupArn` (optional)
  - `KMSKeyId` (optional)
- **Document compliance implications** of minimal vs enhanced configurations
- **Provide post-deployment scripts** for customers to enhance logging

**Implementation Suggestion:**

```yaml
Parameters:
  EnableEnhancedCloudTrail:
    Type: String
    Default: 'false'
    AllowedValues: ['true', 'false']

Conditions:
  EnhancedLogging: !Equals [!Ref EnableEnhancedCloudTrail, 'true']
```

### 5. Lambda Athena Permissions - **SCOPING OPPORTUNITY**

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Immediate:** Document why cross-database access is required
- **Improvement:** Allow customers to specify allowed database prefixes
- **Alternative:** Provide separate templates for single-database vs multi-database deployments

### 6. Network Security - **MIXED FINDINGS**

#### ECS Non-TLS Ports

**Status:** Standard pattern but may not meet strict customer requirements

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Option 1:** Provide parameter to enable end-to-end TLS
- **Option 2:** Document the security boundary clearly (ALB termination)
- **Option 3:** Consider mTLS for internal service communication

#### Port 444

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Document the purpose** clearly in template comments
- **Make it optional** if possible
- **Provide network diagram** showing traffic flows

#### ELB Certificate

**Customer Safety Recommendations:**

- **Pre-deployment checklist** for certificate requirements
- **Validation script** to verify certificate exists in correct region
- **Documentation** on DNS name requirements and limitations

## Overall Customer Safety Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Can implement now)

1. **Enhanced Documentation:** Add comprehensive comments explaining each security design decision
2. **Parameter Options:** Provide optional parameters for security-conscious customers
3. **Deployment Guide:** Create customer-facing security configuration guide
4. **Validation Scripts:** Provide pre-deployment security validation tools

### Medium-term Improvements (Require development)

1. **Policy Templates:** Replace dynamic creation with configurable templates where possible
2. **Conditional Security:** Allow customers to choose security profiles (standard/enhanced)
3. **Monitoring Integration:** Provide CloudWatch dashboards for security monitoring
4. **Compliance Mapping:** Document how configuration maps to common compliance frameworks

### Long-term Evolution (Product roadmap)

1. **Customer Environment Discovery:** Automated scanning to scope permissions appropriately
2. **Graduated Permissions:** Start minimal, expand based on actual usage patterns
3. **Security Automation:** Automated policy optimization based on CloudTrail analysis

## Engineering Verification Needed

**High Priority:**

1. Confirm actual behavior of "blank" policies - are they populated at runtime?
2. Validate necessity of each wildcard permission
3. Review dynamic IAM creation - what specific use cases require this?

**Medium Priority:**

1. Test deployment with more restrictive policies
2. Evaluate customer feedback on current security posture
3. Assess feasibility of conditional security features

**Questions for Product Team:**

1. What customer security requirements are non-negotiable?
2. Are customers willing to accept slightly more complex deployment for better security?
3. What compliance frameworks must be supported?
