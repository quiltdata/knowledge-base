# Quilt Platform Bake Testing Bucket

This bucket is used for final "bake testing" of Quilt Platform features and functionality prior to release.

## Purpose

A dedicated S3 bucket for safely testing and demonstrating bucket management capabilities without affecting production data. Use this environment to explore features, train new users, and validate workflows.

## Testing Guidelines

- This is a sandbox environment - experiment freely with uploads, deletions, and modifications
- Files deleted through the interface receive delete markers but remain recoverable
- All actions are logged for audit and troubleshooting purposes
- Consider cleaning up test files after completing your testing session
- Use descriptive names for test packages to help others understand their purpose

## Common Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Operations**: Upload a file, create a package, then delete the source file
2. **Bulk Processing**: Select multiple files and perform batch operations
3. **Version Testing**: Upload multiple versions of the same file and explore version history
4. **Performance Testing**: Upload large files to test system limits and performance
5. **Workflow Validation**: Complete end-to-end workflows from upload to package distribution

## Support

For questions, issues, or feature requests, please contact the platform administrator or consult the Quilt documentation.
