# Quilt Platform Release 1.62.0

This release focuses on quality of life improvements, enhanced search functionality, and important bug fixes to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.

## New Features

- **URL Redirection for Quilt S3 URLs**  
  Added a redirect page that automatically converts catalog URLs to `quilt+s3://` format, enabling seamless navigation between different URL schemes and improving integration with external applications.

- **Qurator Developer Tools**  
  Introduced comprehensive development tools including model override capabilities and session recording functionality. These tools allow developers to test different AI models and record user sessions for debugging and optimization purposes.

- **Enhanced Search Range Filters**  
  Significantly improved the search experience with better date filtering using an intuitive slider interface, enhanced number range input validation, and robust error handling for invalid date and number inputs.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **Search Robustness**
  - Increased search timeout limits and applied them consistently across all catalog operations
  - Added proper timeout error display in the Catalog interface to provide clear feedback when searches exceed time limits
  - Reduced object match requests in secure mode for improved performance while maintaining security standards
  - Enhanced error handling and validation for invalid search inputs to prevent crashes

- **Stack Deployment & Object Access**
  - Resolved deployment failures that occurred when stack names contained uppercase letters
  - Fixed critical object access issues in OPEN mode that were preventing proper data retrieval and display
  - Applied various minor UI fixes to enhance overall user experience and interface consistency

- **Backend Infrastructure & Performance**
  - Implemented maximum concurrency limits on event source mapping to prevent unnecessary SQS reads during lambda throttling events
  - Updated canary runtime environment to version 10 for improved stability and performance
  - Refreshed Python dependencies to latest compatible versions for security and performance improvements

## Technical Details

This release includes significant infrastructure improvements focused on:

- Enhanced error handling and timeout management in search operations to provide better user feedback
- Improved deployment reliability for edge cases in stack naming conventions
- Performance optimizations for secure mode operations that maintain security while improving speed
- Developer tooling enhancements for better debugging capabilities and testing workflows
- Event source mapping optimizations to reduce unnecessary AWS resource consumption during high-load scenarios
